**LLM.info** is a community-driven platform for discovering, comparing, and understanding AI models and applications. We're building the definitive resource for navigating the AI landscape—whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your tech journey.

## What We Build

| Project | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [**LDF**](https://github.com/LLMdotInfo/ldf) | LLM Development Framework - spec-driven development for AI-assisted engineering | Public |
| [**LDF-VSCode**](https://github.com/LLMdotInfo/ldf-vscode) | VS Code extension for LDF with spec visualization, guardrail tracking, and task management | Public |

## Featured: LDF (LLM Development Framework)

<div align="center">

**A spec-driven development methodology that helps developers build better software with AI assistants.**

</div>

AI coding assistants are powerful but can produce inconsistent results. LDF solves this by enforcing structured thinking before code is written.

### Key Features

- **Structured Workflow**: Requirements → Design → Tasks (no code until approved)
- **8 Core Guardrails**: Testing, security, API design, error handling, and more
- **Multi-AI Support**: Use Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini together for reviews
- **90% Token Savings**: MCP servers provide efficient context vs file reads
- **Industry Presets**: SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare, API-only configurations

### Quick Start

```bash
pip install llm-ldf
ldf init --preset saas
```
